            <p>Steve Jobs was the co-founder and long time chief executive officer of <span>Apple Inc</span>. On June 12,
               2005, Steve Jobs gave the commencement address at Stanford University.</p>
               <p>Here is an inspirational book <cite><a href="http://amazon.com/Steve-Jobs-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1451648537" target="blank">"Steve Jobs"</a> by Walter Isaacson.</cite></p>
            <p>In his very motivational and inspiring address, he urged attendees to follow their dreams and despite any
               set backs, never give up &ndash; advice which steve sincerely took to heart. </p>

            <p> You must first believe in your own dreams. If you do not believe that you can achieve what you want, there’s no way you can make it.
                  Thus, dare to dream and dare to think crazily. It is alright if other people say that you are crazy and it is impossible, let them be.
                  You are you and this is your life. So you get to choose how you want to live and what you want to accomplish.
                  No one believes that Arnold Schwarzenegger is able to make it the bodybuilding and acting career, but he ignored the naysayer and went for it anyway. So he succeeded.
                  You have to be the same. Trust yourself and believe in your dreams.
                  So are you ready to put a dent in the universe?</p>

                &#8220;There is a strange sensation often experienced in the presence of an audience. It may proceed from the gaze of
               the many eyes that turn upon the speaker, especially if he permits himself to steadily return that gaze. Most
               speakers have been conscious of this in a nameless thrill, a real something, pervading the atmosphere,
               tangible, evanescent, indescribable. All writers have borne testimony to the power of a speaker's eye in
               impressing an audience. This influence which we are now considering is the reverse of that picture &ndash; the power
               their eyes may exert upon him, especially before he begins to speak: after the inward fires of oratory are
               fanned into flame the eyes of the audience lose all terror.&#8221; &ndash; <cite><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6554549-extempore-speech" target="blank">

            <h5><span>Effective Event Planning- <br>5 Event Planning Skills You Need To Succeed</span></h5>
            <p><span>Effective Organizational Skills-</span> In event planning, success is in the details. And there are many of
              them! Keeping track of numerous tasks, multiple vendors, and constantly changing to-do lists all at once—while
              keeping your client happy—can be challenging for some and daunting for others.
              Being highly organized is a must for successful event planning. For those who make and manage to-do lists in
              their personal lives, being organized may come naturally. For others who struggle to remember deadlines or to
              pick up the dry cleaning, being organized may require more effort.</p><br>
            <p><span>Interpersonal Skills-</span> What do all events have in common? People. Successful event planners are
              personable, engaging, good conversationalists, and excellent listeners. Event planning is a social profession
              in that the result – the event itself – will include a group of people, large or small. Understanding people
              and enjoying talking to them is part of the job.
              This does not mean that, as an event planner, you will spend most of your day at client lunches and having
              cocktails at social events. Event planning is hard work, and much of it is spent at a desk with a phone or
              computer; however, a personable demeanor is a must when tackling common event- planning tasks.</p><br>
            <p><span>Excellent communication skills-</span> In event planning, miscommunication can result in numerous problems
              for both the event planner and the client, and a simple misunderstanding can have catastrophic results.
              Therefore, the ability to listen is crucial so that you understand the needs of the client.</p><br>
            <p><span>Creativity-</span> Successful event planners have ideas – lots of them. And with that creativity comes the
              ability to transform the idea into something tangible. Event planners can take a vision and bring it to life.
              From developing a unique theme for a party to coming up with an affordable decorating solution that meets a
              small budget, creativity is essential when planning an event.
              Creativity also plays a role in problem-solving. Being able to think creatively to develop solutions to
              problems can positively impact the success of your event.</p><br>
            <p><span>Multi-tasking-</span> At various stages of the event- planning process, there are numerous tasks to manage.
              You may be negotiating a hotel contract, meeting with a client to discuss potential guest speakers, booking a
              caterer, interviewing rental vendors, and exploring entertainment options. And that is just for one event. Add
              multiple events in the planning stages all at once, and the end result is a juggling act. Successful event
              planners need to know how to effectively multitask and keep many aspects of the event moving along
              simultaneously without dropping the ball on any of those tasks.</p>
