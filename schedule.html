          <h5>Effective Event Planning- 5 Event Planning Skills You Need To Succeed</h5>
            <p><em>Effective Organizational Skills-</em> In event planning, success is in the details. And there are many of them! Keeping track of numerous tasks, multiple vendors, and constantly changing to-do lists all at once—while keeping your client happy—can be challenging for some and daunting for others.
              Being highly organized is a must for successful event planning. For those who make and manage to-do lists in their personal lives, being organized may come naturally. For others who struggle to remember deadlines or to pick up the dry cleaning, being organized may require more effort.</p>
            <p><strong>Interpersonal Skills-</strong> What do all events have in common? People. Successful event planners are personable, engaging, good conversationalists, and excellent listeners. Event planning is a social profession in that the result – the event itself – will include a group of people, large or small. Understanding people and enjoying talking to them is part of the job.
              This does not mean that, as an event planner, you will spend most of your day at client lunches and having cocktails at social events. Event planning is hard work, and much of it is spent at a desk with a phone or computer; however, a personable demeanor is a must when tackling common event-planning tasks.</p>
            <p><strong>Excellent communication skills-</strong>  In event planning, miscommunication can result in numerous problems for both the event planner and the client, and a simple misunderstanding can have catastrophic results. Therefore, the ability to listen is crucial so that you understand the needs of the client.</p>
            <p><strong>Creativity-</strong> Successful event planners have ideas – lots of them. And with that creativity comes the ability to transform the idea into something tangible. Event planners can take a vision and bring it to life. From developing a unique theme for a party to coming up with an affordable decorating solution that meets a small budget, creativity is essential when planning an event.
              Creativity also plays a role in problem-solving. Being able to think creatively to develop solutions to problems can positively impact the success of your event.</p>
            <p><strong>Multi-tasking-</strong> At various stages of the event-planning process, there are numerous tasks to manage. You may be negotiating a hotel contract, meeting with a client to discuss potential guest speakers, booking a caterer, interviewing rental vendors, and exploring entertainment options. And that is just for one event. Add multiple events in the planning stages all at once, and the end result is a juggling act. Successful event planners need to know how to effectively multitask and keep many aspects of the event moving along simultaneously without dropping the ball on any of those tasks.</p>
